## Contributing

Please do not commit any additional cpp source files, or header files to the repo, all versioning should be handled by a history of commits. Please do not knowingly commit broken code. If problems arise in code, it would be preferred to use Github issue tracking for project specific communication. 

[`/Project1-test.cpp`](/Project1-test.cpp) is provided as a sample cpp hello world file for testing your g++ compilation environment.

For simplicity, each developer has their own distribution files folder [`./dist-cole`](/dist-cole), [`./dist-josiah`](/dist-josiah), and [`./dist-andrew`](/dist-andrew). This is where each compilation file should compile to.

Recognize that each developer can write their own `g++` compilation command file. For example [`/compile-cole.bat`](/compile-cole.bat) compiles to the [`./dist-cole`](/dist-cole) folder.

Any design documents need to be put into a /documents folder, where we can outline roughly how our application works.
